# Luka's Developer Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It was built to introduce myself and showcase my projects, skills, and development journey.

The site is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **TypeScript**, **GSAP** for animations, and **Lenis** for smooth scrolling.  
The project structure was generated using **Vite** for fast development and bundling.

## Development

To run the project locally:
    
    cd <project-root>
    npm install
    npm run dev
